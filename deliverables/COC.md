**Team Code of Conduct**

**1. Goals and Philosophy**

We, as Group 16, commit to fostering an inclusive and respectful
environment where all members can contribute effectively. Our core
principles are collaboration, accountability, and mutual respect. We aim
to deliver a high-quality Unit Set Builder interface by adhering to
agreed-upon norms and supporting each other throughout the project.

**2. Communication**

- **Preferred Modes:** We will use Microsoft Teams for day-to-day
  communication. Email will be used for formal communication, especially
  when contacting our client, Maryam Vettoo (maryam.vettoor@uwa.edu.au).

- **Response Time:** All team members are expected to respond to
  messages within 24 hours during weekdays.

- **Project Management Tools:** We will use Github to track tasks,
  deadlines, and progress.

- **Client communication:** Ankita Narvekar will be reponsible for
  communicating a client. The content of official emails has to be
  reviewed by each team member.

- **Facilitator communication:** Siting Xiang will be responsible for
  communicating the facilitator. The content of official emails has to
  be reviewed by each team member.

**3. Meetings**

- Meeting with the facilitator (Allen Ji) -- each Monday at 5:30 PM

- Internal meeting - each Tuesday at 8:00 PM

- **Agenda Setting:** Each meeting will have a note-taker and agenda
  setter -- Joel Qian.

**4. Planning and Task Management**

- **Task Assignment:** Tasks will be assigned during meetings or via
  Github, with clear deadlines and responsible members.

- **Deadlines:** All tasks should be completed by the agreed-upon
  deadlines. If a deadline cannot be met, the responsible member must
  inform the team at least 48 hours in advance.

- **Milestones:** We will set project milestones during the planning
  phase and review them regularly to ensure we are on track, especially
  focusing on the UI and data structure development.

**5. Decision-Making and Conflict Resolution**

- **Decision-Making:** Decisions will be made by consensus whenever
  possible. If consensus cannot be reached, we will vote, with the
  majority decision being final.

- **Conflict Resolution:** Any conflicts should be addressed directly
  between the parties involved. If a resolution cannot be reached, the
  issue will be brought to the team for discussion and resolution.

**6. Time-Keeping**

- **Meeting Punctuality:** All members are expected to be on time for
  meetings. If someone cannot attend, they must inform the group at
  least 24 hours in advance.

- **Task Progress:** We will monitor task progress through Github, with
  regular check-ins to ensure timely completion, particularly focusing
  on handling the diverse and complex scenarios in the project.

**7. Review and Adaptation**

- **Regular Review:** The CoC will be reviewed at the midpoint of the
  project to assess its effectiveness. Adjustments will be made based on
  team feedback and any challenges encountered.

- **Final Reflection:** At the end of the project, we will reflect on
  our adherence to the CoC and discuss any lessons learned to improve
  future teamwork.
